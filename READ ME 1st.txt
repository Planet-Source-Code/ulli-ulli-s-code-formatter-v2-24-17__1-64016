This Visual Basic Add-In will format your code for a generally accepted indentation - one tab per structure level, the tab width being obtained from the IDE. It will also check your code for some of the most common ommissions and traps. Included are a Code Printer, a Copy Facility, a Code Structure Viewer and an option to create WinXP manifest files and to modify your code to make use of them.

Simply compile the DLL into your VB directory and then use the AddIns Manager to add it to the AddIns Menu.

VB seems to be a bit sluggish when a summary is inserted into the code pane, I don't know why that is so.

See dCodeFormatter (dCodeFormat.Dsr) for a complete list of modifications, fixes, and known quirks.
